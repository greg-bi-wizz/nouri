Summary
Project Overview

We are seeking an experienced Power BI consultant to build an initial Marketing & Communications KPI dashboard and, equally important, advise on the data architecture and system connections required to support a multi-phase reporting roadmap.

Our immediate need is a Phase 1 Power BI dashboard that consolidates stable marketing data sources into a single, executive-ready view. Longer-term, this dashboard must be designed to scale into additional phases as our website, SharePoint, and Salesforce (Technomile) environments mature.

This is not a “one-and-done” dashboard project. We are intentionally building a foundation.



Current State

We currently use:

- Sprout Social: Social media analytics
- HubSpot: Email marketing (limited use today; expanded use planned)
- Google Analytics (GA4): Website analytics (current site; new site launching in early 2026)
- Salesforce with Technomile Growth: Business development CRM (immature for marketing attribution)
- Press / Event metrics: Manual tracking or Mentionlytics

Each platform has its own dashboard. We lack:
- A unified KPI view
- Cross-channel insight
- Exportable leadership reporting
- Clear visibility into how MarCom supports long-term pipeline development



Phase 1 Scope (This Engagement)

Goal: Build an initial Power BI KPI dashboard using stable data sources and establish a scalable data model.

Phase 1 Deliverables

1. Power BI KPI Dashboard
- Executive-ready summary view (monthly/quarterly)
- Channel-level performance (social, email, high-level web traffic, press/events)
- Drill-down capability for trend analysis
- Designed for clean PPT/PDF export

2. Data Model & KPI Standardization
- Defined KPIs (impressions, engagement, engagement rate, CTR, traffic sources, etc.)
- Clear metric definitions and formulas
- Structured data ingestion approach (API vs. manual CSV uploads)

3. Documentation & Handoff
- Data dictionary
- Instructions for monthly data refresh
- Brief walkthrough (Loom or live)



Future-State Advisory (Critical Part of This Role)

In addition to building the Phase 1 dashboard, the consultant must advise on future phases so the system is designed correctly from the start.

You will be asked to provide recommendations (not build work yet) for:

- Phase 2: Website + SharePoint analytics integration after both environments are rebuilt (early 2026)

- Phase 3: Salesforce / Technomile data readiness for marketing attribution (fields, lifecycle mapping, HubSpot → Salesforce connections)

- Phase 4: Marketing → pipeline influence dashboards once CRM architecture is ready

This advisory component may be delivered as:
- A short written architecture summary
- A data flow diagram
- A checklist of required connections, fields, and prerequisites


What This Project Is NOT

- Not a Salesforce dashboard build
- Not a demand-gen attribution model (yet)
- Not a Marketing Cloud or enterprise automation implementation

This is a foundational analytics project for a small, growing MarCom team.


Required Experience

- Advanced Power BI dashboard development
- Strong data modeling and KPI design skills
- Experience working with marketing data (social, email, web)
- Ability to design scalable, phased BI architectures
- Comfortable advising non-technical stakeholders
- Strong documentation skills

Nice to Have

- HubSpot experience
- Salesforce experience (especially reporting or data architecture)
- GA4 familiarity
- B2B or B2G services experience
